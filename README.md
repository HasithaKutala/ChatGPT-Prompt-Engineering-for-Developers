This course is taught by Isa Fulford (OpenAI) and Andrew Ng (DeepLearning.AI) will describe how LLMs work, provide best practices for prompt engineering, and show how LLM APIs can be used in applications for a variety of tasks. 

# What you’ll learn in this course

In ChatGPT Prompt Engineering for Developers, you will learn how to use a large language model (LLM) to quickly build new and powerful applications.  Using the OpenAI API, you’ll be able to quickly build capabilities that learn to innovate and create value in ways that were cost-prohibitive, highly technical, or simply impossible before now.

# Topics discussed

Introduction
Guideliness on how to write clear prompts.
Summarizing (e.g., summarizing user reviews for brevity)
Inferring (e.g., sentiment classification, topic extraction)
Transforming text (e.g., translation, spelling & grammar correction)
Expanding (e.g., automatically writing emails)
Building Chatbot 

# Chatbot

how to automate the collection of user prompts and assistant responses to build an OrderBot. The OrderBot is designed to take orders at a pizza restaurant. By using the provided code, we can interact with the bot and simulate a conversation.

The code includes a collect_messages function that collects user prompts and assistant responses. It appends the messages to a context list, which is then used to generate the completion from the OpenAI API. The messages are displayed using a graphical user interface (GUI) provided by the panel library.

We can initiate a conversation by entering prompts in the text input field and clicking the "Chat!" button. The conversation between the user and the OrderBot is displayed in the GUI, with user prompts on the left and assistant responses on the right.
